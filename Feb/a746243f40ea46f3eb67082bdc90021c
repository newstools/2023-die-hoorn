FORMER Oudtshoorn High school student, Zac Lipschitz, has recently returned to his hometown Oudtshoorn and joined the James King and Badenhorst Inc. group as a candidate attorney.Lipschitz, who matriculated in 2017, enrolled at the North-West University, Potchefstroom campus, after he finished school.There he began studying for his BCom law degree as well as his LLB degree.“I remember how I used to pack the lettering for the information and adverts on the board when I was at school here,” he tells Die Hoorn.According to him this was the duty of the head boy of the school.Returning to his roots, history repeated itself five years later when Lipschitz assisted in putting up the new branding for James King and Badenhorst Inc on the school’s information board.This well-kown information board is situated on the corner of Voortrekker Road and Jan van Riebeek Street.Be on the lookout for the new signage as well as this young man and his bright future at this Oudtshoorn attorney’s firm.
